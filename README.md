This project was fun to build. I learnt about incorporating icons to my CSS file and this was a good refresher on the onClick attribute! Also helped solidify my CSS knowledge :). Took me a good 7 hours from start to finish (timed religiously).

### Built With

- Just the basics: JavaScript, HTML and CSS on VScode!

I also used the below two for images and icons.
